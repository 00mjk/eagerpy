# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install the latest release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/eagerpy/) using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install eagerpy
```

EagerPy requires Python 3.6 or newer. Besides that, all essential dependencies are automatically installed. To use it with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, or NumPy, the respective framework needs to be installed separately. These frameworks are not declared as dependencies because not everyone wants to use and thus install all of them and because some of these packages have different builds for different architectures and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) versions.

::: warning NOTE
EagerPy requires Python 3.6 or newer.
